# Notes

## Basics of Git
- Initialize repository in Github first, then clone to vs code using the URL
- Basic git pattern:
    1. Always pull before making a commit to avoid conflicts
    2. Make changes to the code
    3. Commit the changes
    4. Push the changes to github
- Use git status to check the current state of the files
- To resolve conflicts using vs code:
    1. Open the file with the conflict
    2. Open the source control tab and click the three dots
    3. Select Branch > Merge Branch
    4. Remove the textual conflict delimiters and modify the file to be how it should be
    5. Commit and push the revised file
- Forking a repo is essentially copying it to experiment with, but a pull request can suggest changes to the author if desired
